# Power Coding

Seven layers (0–6) that make an AI-assisted project fast, debuggable, and resumable — for any
coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI…), because everything lives in plain
markdown files the agent re-reads every session. Together they implement **the Five
Forces of Mindful Coding**: *Alignment* counters ambiguity (brief, architecture
sign-off, decisions, scope brake), *Memory* counters amnesia (Handoff, Learning,
checkpoints), *the Loop* counters drift (evals → tests), *Sight* counters opacity
(diagrams, Pulse), *Foresight* counters entropy (FMEA, Sentinel, security baseline).

**How anything here happens "automatically":** agents only reliably re-read two things —
the platform's instructions file and files those instructions point to. So setup writes
one pointer block into the instructions file (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `GEMINI.md`;
create `AGENTS.md` if none exists), and every automatic behavior below is an instruction
stored in `Handoff.MD` / `Learning.MD` / `Loop.MD` that the pointer forces back into
context. No daemon, no hook required — redundancy of written instructions is the
mechanism.

Asking questions: use the platform's structured-question tool if one exists, otherwise
ask in plain text. If the run is non-interactive, choose sensible defaults and mark them
`⚠️ unconfirmed` for the user to review.

---

## FIRST INVOKE — configure the project (this exact order)

Detect state first: if `Handoff.MD` exists at the repo root, the project is already
configured — skip to **Ongoing duties** (and offer to re-run any single layer if the
user asked for that).

### Layer 0 — Brief (OPTIONAL — the product context everything else reads)

Loop.MD evals are drafted from the brief and FMEA scans cross-reference it. Detect
first: if the repo already has a real brief (`PRD.md`, `docs/prd*`, `design.MD`, or a
README that genuinely describes the product — not just install steps), confirm it with
the user and use it as-is: **no interview, no PRD.md created**. Only if nothing
qualifies, OFFER the brief — never force it:

> "I couldn't find a product brief (no design.MD or README with product detail). A
> one-page PRD.md makes the evals and failure scans product-aware instead of generic —
> want to answer 4 quick questions to create one?
> (a) What are you building, in one or two sentences?
> (b) Who uses it, and for what?
> (c) What must NEVER break — where would a failure cost money, data, or trust?
> (d) What does 'done' for v1 look like — the smallest version that proves it works?
> Or **skip** — you can add it anytime with `power-coding brief`."

Answered → write `PRD.md` from `assets/PRD.template.md` (plain language, one page max);
it becomes `context_sources.prd_path` in 4b. Skipped → leave `prd_path` null, draft
Loop.MD evals from the user's stated goal instead, and prefix every FMEA scan output
with one line: "⚠️ running without product context — findings are code-level only".
Non-interactive run → draft PRD.md from the code and README, mark every section
`⚠️ unconfirmed`.

**Also at Layer 0: make the repo safe to iterate in.** If there is no git repo, `git
init` and make an initial commit (tell the user why: checkpoints are the rollback path
when a change breaks the app). If there is no `.gitignore`, create one covering `.env*`,
build output, and dependency folders BEFORE the first commit — a secret committed once
is compromised forever, even if deleted later.

### Layer 1 — Harnessing (session continuity)

**1a. Create `Handoff.MD`** from `assets/HANDOFF.template.md`, then ask (multi-choice,
multi-select):

> "I've built **Handoff.MD** so you can work across multiple sessions seamlessly.
> What would you like in it?
> (a) Compact summary of the previous session's work
> (b) Current state
> (c) Pending points
> (d) Anything else — tell me"

Build exactly the sections chosen (for an existing repo, pre-fill them from a scan of
the code, git log, and any docs; for a new project, fill from the user's description of
what they're building). Then tell the user, verbatim enough to be copy-pastable:

> "From now on, to continue in a fresh session just type:
> **Refer to Handoff.MD in `<absolute project path>` and begin**
> The new session will open with your pending points (if any) or ask what you'd like
> to do next."

**1b. Standing session rules** (these also get written into Handoff.MD's header so any
agent that reads the file inherits them):

- Update Handoff.MD **after every major code change** (new module, changed flow,
  milestone done, decision taken) — rewrite as a current-state snapshot, don't append a
  journal. Keep it one screen; history belongs in Learning.MD and git.
- When **~10% of context remains** (the platform warns about context, compaction has
  started, or you judge the conversation is near its limit): update Handoff.MD
  immediately — *before* quality degrades — and tell the user:
  > "Context is nearly full — Handoff.MD is up to date. Please start a fresh session
  > with: *Refer to Handoff.MD in `<path>` and begin*."
- A session that **starts** with the magic phrase (or in any repo containing
  Handoff.MD): read it fully FIRST, then open with the pending points ("Last time these
  were pending: … — continue with these, or something else?") or, if none, "What would
  you like to do now?"
- **Git checkpoints:** commit whenever the app reaches a working state, and always
  *before* a risky change (refactor, dependency upgrade, schema/data migration). Never
  leave a working state uncommitted — the checkpoint is the rollback path when the next
  change breaks the app, and rollback beats a debugging spiral. Because commits mutate
  repo state, ask ONCE at setup: "**auto** — I commit checkpoints myself and announce
  each in one line — or **propose** — I ask before each one?" (recommend auto; a
  proposed-but-ignored checkpoint protects nobody). Store as
  `consent.git_checkpoints: "auto" | "propose"` in `.power-coding/config.json`.
- **Scope brake:** before starting any feature, state the smallest version that proves
  it works (measured against PRD.md's "Done for v1") and build that first — checkpoint,
  then extend. Extensions the user didn't ask for are waste, not initiative.
- **Decision log:** any decision that shapes stack, architecture, or product behavior
  gets one line in Handoff.MD's `Decisions` section (date — what — why). Never silently
  reverse a logged decision — surface the conflict and ask; if the section outgrows the
  one-screen rule, move older entries to `docs/DECISIONS.md` and keep a pointer.

**1c. Create `Learning.MD`** from `assets/LEARNING.template.md` — auto-enabled. It is
read AND updated whenever: the basic flow of the app changes, the user reports a bug or
gives corrective feedback, or something took real time to figure out. Each entry follows
the template's 5-whys format: the symptom, a Why-chain drilled until the deepest why
(typed `code` / `design` / `process` / `knowledge-gap`), the action taken (and which
"why" level it targeted), and a preventive action for the whole class of bug. Tell the
user:

> "I've also enabled **Learning.MD** — I'll log flow changes, bugs you report, and
> their root causes there, so future sessions don't repeat them. Say the word if you'd
> rather not have it."

**1d. Write the pointer block** into the instructions file (this is what makes 1b, 1c,
and Layer 2's automation survive every future session):

```markdown
## Power Coding (auto — do not remove without asking the user)
At session start read Handoff.MD; open with its pending points. Update Handoff.MD
after major changes and when ~10% of context remains (then tell the user to start a
fresh session with: "Refer to Handoff.MD in <path> and begin").
Log flow changes / user-reported bugs in Learning.MD (5-whys entry format).
Read Loop.MD every session and obey its `status:` machine — when the first working
draft is done, ASK the user whether to turn the loop on (disclosing the free/paid eval
split); while `status: on`, run the FREE Loop.MD evals after every meaningful change
and report per-eval pass/fail. The golden set / paid evals run ONLY per
consent.paid_evals (ask by default — offer at milestones, never auto per-change).
Keep docs/mermaid/*.mmd current when the flow changes (see docs/ARCHITECTURE_FLOW.md).
Obey .power-coding/config.json FMEA triggers: if on_pre_commit, run the light FMEA
scan on the staged diff BEFORE any commit you make (P0 → block and ask); if
on_feature_complete, full scan when a feature is declared done; if smart_suggest,
suggest a scan at a natural pause when its signals fire (never twice for the same
changes). The config's failure_categories list is the mandatory checklist.
If sentinel is enabled in .power-coding/config.json, run the four-lens Sentinel Scan
silently after every major task completion — flag only what fires, one line each.
If session_pulse is enabled, show a 2-line effort split (feature/support/rework) after
major milestones and log it in Handoff.MD updates.
Commit a git checkpoint at every working state and before any risky change (obey
consent.git_checkpoints: auto = commit + one-line announce, propose = ask first).
Before starting a feature, build the smallest version that proves it works (per PRD.md's
"Done for v1"), checkpoint, then extend. Any architecture-shaping change (new service,
external dependency, data-model change, async flow) gets a plain-language delta proposal
against the current diagram and user approval BEFORE code. Log
stack/architecture/behavior decisions as one line in Handoff.MD's Decisions; never
silently reverse a logged decision. PRD.md is the product context for evals and scans —
keep it current. Full FMEA scans obey consent.fmea_full_scan (ask | auto).
```

### Layer 2 — Loop Engineering (evals that finetune the app)

Read `references/loop-engineering.md` for the full protocol. Setup steps:

**2a. Create `Loop.MD`** from `assets/LOOP.template.md`, and **draft 3–6 example FREE
evals from the project itself** — read the brief/README/docs `.md` files (existing
project) or the user's stated goal (new project) and write concrete Q→expected-A pairs
(for an agentic system: input → expected behavior; for an app: action → expected
result). These are labelled EXAMPLES. **Then classify the product:** if its core output
is LLM-generated or a core flow calls paid APIs, also draft a **golden set** from the
brief (8–12 samples: typical, hard/edge, must-refuse; each with a check method —
exact / contains / rubric) and set `consent.paid_evals: "ask"` in the config. See
"Golden set" and "Cost consent" in `references/loop-engineering.md`.

**2b. Ask the user to make it theirs:**

> "**Loop.MD** is ready with example evals drafted from your project docs. Please edit
> it: state your goal for the app, and replace/extend the examples with real
> questions-and-expected-answers. These become the yardstick the loop finetunes
> against."

**2c. The automatic loop offer.** Loop.MD carries `status: waiting_for_first_draft` and
an agent instruction block. The moment the agent completes a **first working draft**
(the core path runs end-to-end once), it must ask:

> "First draft is working. Want me to **turn on the Loop**? After each change I'll run
> the free evals in Loop.MD (they cost nothing), show you per-eval pass/fail, and keep
> finetuning until they pass. The golden set costs real API money — I'll only run it
> when you approve or at milestones."

The cost split in that offer is mandatory, not optional wording — turning the loop on
consents ONLY to free evals; paid runs stay per-approval (`consent.paid_evals`).

User says yes → `status: on`. This trigger is stored in three places on purpose
(pointer block, Loop.MD itself, and a Handoff.MD pending item "offer the loop when
first draft is ready") so it fires even sessions later, on any LLM.

**2d. While the loop is on:** after each meaningful change — cheapest checks first
(typecheck/tests if the repo has them), then walk the FREE Loop.MD evals, report a
per-eval ✅/❌ table, fix, repeat. The golden set NEVER runs automatically per-change:
per `consent.paid_evals`, offer it at milestones ("feature complete — run the golden
set? ~N paid calls") or on request. Any paid run gets a one-line written hypothesis in
Loop.MD's run journal *before* running, and failures get reproduced as free checks
before re-spending — never use a paid check as a debugger.

**2e. Eval graduation (the loop matures into a test suite):** when an eval has passed
3 consecutive loop runs, offer to codify it as an automated test in the repo's stack —
creating the minimal test setup first if none exists (one test runner, one example
test, a one-line run command; explain what it's for, since the user may never have had
one). A graduated eval is marked `(graduated → <test file>)` in Loop.MD and runs in
step "cheapest first" instead of the manual walkthrough — the loop gets *faster* as the
app matures, and the user ends up with a real regression suite without ever being asked
to "write tests".

### Layer 3 — Vibe Debugging (see the flow instead of reading code)

Ask exactly this and wait:

> "For debugging, do you want **(A)** only Mermaid `.mmd` diagram files (+ a standalone
> HTML viewer), or **(B)** also a **temporary, local-only debug tab inside the app**
> that renders them live?"

Then execute the diagram protocol — read `references/diagram-convention.md` and follow
it exactly:

1. **Discover** the real runtime flow by reading entry points and tracing the main path
   (never guess). Classify each step AGENT / FUNCTION / LIBRARY / DATA with its in/out.
2. **Author** `docs/mermaid/NN-title.mmd` (master flow first, then per-module) — one
   step per box, decisions as diamonds with branch conditions, gates with thresholds,
   every "ask the user" step states who composes the question. New project with no code
   yet → draw the *intended* architecture, marked `%% intended — not yet built`.
3. **Validate**: `node <skill-path>/scripts/validate-mmd.mjs docs/mermaid`.
4. **Build the viewer**: `node <skill-path>/scripts/build-html.mjs docs/mermaid
   docs/architecture-flow.html` — dependency-free, open in any browser.
5. **(B only)** Scaffold the in-app debug tab per `references/debug-tab-recipes.md`
   (Next.js / Vite recipes; anything else → the standalone viewer). Label it visibly as
   a debug aid, keep it local-only (exclude from production builds or gate on
   `NODE_ENV !== "production"`), and verify it serves before declaring done.
6. Be honest about **staleness**: diagrams are authored, not auto-generated. The tab
   shows a stale banner (newest source mtime vs diagram mtime); update the `.mmd` in
   the same session as any structural change — the git diff of the `.mmd` IS the
   change-highlight.

**3-align. Architecture alignment (always — this step is never optional).** The user
must approve the shape of the system before code is built against it — a wrong
architecture caught at proposal time costs one conversation; caught after build, a
rewrite. The user may not read code, but they CAN judge a plain-language proposal.

- **New project:** after drawing the intended-architecture diagram, walk it in plain
  language — one line per component: *what it is, why this choice, and its main
  trade-off* ("one Postgres database — simplest thing that scales to thousands of
  users; trade-off: a single point to back up"). End with the failure the user would
  care most about ("if the server restarts mid-payment, X happens"). Then WAIT for
  approval before building. Approval → one line in Handoff.MD's `Decisions`.
- **Existing project:** after discovering the real flow (step 1), confirm it back:
  "This is how your app actually works — [3–5 plain-language lines + the diagram].
  Does this match your understanding?" Mismatches are gold: either the diagram is
  wrong (fix it) or the user's mental model is (fix that — cheaper now than
  mid-debugging).
- **Major enhancements (ongoing, forever):** before building anything that changes the
  shape — new service, new external dependency, data-model change, new async flow —
  present the delta against the current diagram in plain language (what changes, why,
  trade-off), WAIT for approval, then update the `.mmd` and log the decision. The
  scope-brake moment is the anchor: if stating the smallest version reveals a shape
  change, alignment comes before code.

### Layer 4 — FMEA (Failure Mode & Effect Analysis)

FMEA is a reliability-engineering pass (aerospace/automotive lineage): for every code
path, ask *what can go wrong, what does the user feel, what causes it*, and score
Severity × Occurrence × Detection → **RPN** (Risk Priority Number; higher = fix first).
This is NOT lint — it's an LLM reasoning pass that cross-references the diff against the
**product brief and architecture** to find cross-layer failures no single-layer review
catches (frontend assumes 200 but backend rate-limits 429; PRD promises batch-50 but the
queue has no backpressure; webhook races user creation).

**4a. Activation prompt** (also re-runnable later via `power-coding fmea-config`):

> 🔍 **FMEA Scanner — Failure Mode & Effect Analysis**
> Proactively finds how your code can fail in production by cross-referencing changes
> against your product brief and architecture.
> **When should I run FMEA? (select one or more)**
> **[1]** 🏗️ **After major feature builds** — when you say "feature complete" or a
> feature branch is review-ready. Best for architectural/integration failure modes.
> **[2]** 📦 **Before every commit** — light diff-only scan before each commit I make;
> P0 findings block and ask "fix now or commit anyway?".
> **[3]** 🧠 **Smart mode** — I watch for signals (big diffs, new API integrations,
> payment/billing, async/queue code, error-handling or auth changes) and suggest a scan
> at a natural pause. You approve or skip each time.
> **[4]** 🔇 **Off** — manual only; say "run fmea" or "scan for failures" anytime.
> *(Change anytime with: `power-coding fmea-config`)*

**4b. Store the choice** in `.power-coding/config.json` (create from
`assets/fmea-config.template.json`; set the four trigger booleans from the answer —
multiple selections are valid; `manual_only: true` overrides the others). Set
`context_sources.prd_path` to the Layer 0 brief (`PRD.md` or the existing design.MD /
README the user confirmed); if Layer 0 was skipped, leave it null — scans then carry
the "⚠️ running without product context" prefix, since without a brief FMEA degrades
to generic code review. The FULL scan is expensive (minutes of reading and reasoning),
so `consent.fmea_full_scan` defaults to `"ask"`: on feature-complete, ask "run the
full FMEA scan now, or after you've reviewed the diff?" — users who want it silent set
`"auto"`. The pre-commit LIGHT scan stays automatic (it's fast and anchored to the
commit), but its P0 block always asks. The config deliberately carries the
full `failure_categories` list and scoring thresholds, so ANY agent reading the repo can
run a faithful scan even without this skill installed.

**4c. Scan protocol** — read `references/fmea.md` before every scan and follow it: input
collection per trigger, the **mandatory 12-category walkthrough** (systematic coverage
is the whole value — check every category explicitly, report even the empty ones),
calibrated S/O/D anchors, RPN → P0/P1/P2, and the markdown-table output format.

**4d. Day-one security baseline** — run ONCE at setup (FMEA is diff-scoped and
trigger-gated; the classic day-one disasters happen before any trigger fires and are
permanent once pushed). One pass, three checks:

1. **Secrets:** grep tracked files for API keys / tokens / passwords / connection
   strings; verify `.env*` is gitignored (Layer 0 should have done this — verify, don't
   assume); no secrets referenced in client-side code. A secret already committed →
   treat as compromised: rotate it, don't just delete the line.
2. **Enforcement side:** anything involving money, auth, quotas, or data deletion must
   be enforced server-side — a client-side check is a suggestion, not a rule.
3. **Inputs:** external input that reaches a database, filesystem, or shell is
   validated/parameterized.

Findings are fixed NOW (before the next push), not logged for later. Record
`modules.security_baseline.done: true` in `.power-coding/config.json` when clean. New
code after this is covered by FMEA's `security_access_control` category and Sentinel's
stop-signal lens — the baseline exists because those only see what changes.

### Layer 5 — Sentinel Scan (background quality sweep)

A silent four-lens check that runs after every major task completion (module done,
feature branch ready, significant refactor finished). No files, no reports — inline
one-line flags only when something fires.

**5a. Activation prompt** (also re-runnable via `power-coding sentinel-config`):

> 🛡️ **Sentinel Scan — Background Quality Sweep**
> After every major completion, I run a fast silent check: misuse traps in your code,
> signals I should've stopped and asked, silent runtime failure gaps, and waste I
> introduced. No output when clean — one-line flags when something fires.
> **Activate?** [1] ✅ Yes — after every major completion *(recommended)*
> [2] 🔇 No — manual only (`run sentinel`)

Store the choice in `.power-coding/config.json` under `modules.sentinel`
(`enabled` / `manual_only`; option 2 flips both).

**5b. The four lenses** (one pass, not four separate checks):

- **🔒 Misuse traps** (Poka-Yoke) — functions/APIs/configs the next person can silently
  misuse: `any` where union fits, booleans where enums are clearer, skippable steps in
  multi-step ops, config keys where typos fall through to defaults.
- **🛑 Stop signals** (Andon) — should I have stopped: code vs Handoff.MD/diagram
  contradiction, ambiguous spec where I guessed, touching 2+ Learning.MD fragility
  entries, billing/auth/delete changes without tests.
- **⚡ Silent failures** (Jidoka) — runtime invisibility: unvalidated external API
  shapes, async without dead-letter, client-only business rules, retry without breaker,
  financial writes without read-back.
- **🗑️ Waste** (Muda) — unnecessary additions: redundant deps, passthrough
  abstractions, pointless re-serialization, undated TODOs.

Flag format (only when triggered):
> `🛡️ Sentinel: [lens emoji] [one-line description of what fired]`

No batched reports. Flags appear inline at the end of the completion message. Multiple
flags are fine — one line each.

**Budget:** stay under ~300 tokens of reasoning per run. Each lens is one boolean
question ("does this apply to what I just built — yes or no?"), not an analysis. The
moment a flag needs more than one line of explanation, it belongs in FMEA instead —
the Sentinel just points, it doesn't diagnose.

### Layer 6 — Session Pulse (effort awareness)

A 2-line signal after major milestones showing where the session's effort went:
feature work vs support/environment work vs rework. No file, no report — one line
with the split, one line with the takeaway. Borrowed from OEE (Overall Equipment
Effectiveness): the availability/performance/quality split reveals the real bottleneck,
which is almost never "writing code slowly" — it's environment friction, lost context,
or rework.

**6a. Activation prompt** (re-runnable via `power-coding pulse-config`):

> 📊 **Session Pulse — Effort Awareness**
> After major milestones, a 2-line signal: where did the effort go — feature work vs
> support/friction vs rework? Spots when sessions spend more time on the wrong things.
> **Activate?** [1] ✅ Yes — after major milestones *(recommended)* [2] 🔇 No

Store the choice in `.power-coding/config.json` under `modules.session_pulse.enabled`.

**6b. Behavior:** the agent estimates a three-bucket split from its own conversation
history — a rough mental tally, NOT a file or counter; ±10% is fine, the signal is
directional:

- **🎯 Feature work** — code, design, decisions that directly advance the asked task
- **🔧 Support work** — env setup, dependency/config/build/CI issues, re-reading code
  for context, doc/API lookups
- **🔁 Rework** — fixing bugs written this session, undoing a failed approach, redoing
  misunderstood requirements

Signal format — appended at the very end of the completion message, after any Sentinel
flags:

> `📊 Pulse: 🎯 ~65% feature · 🔧 ~25% support · 🔁 ~10% rework`
> `   └─ [one-line takeaway]`

Rules:
- Only after MAJOR milestones (feature complete, first working draft, branch
  review-ready), never after every small change.
- The takeaway must be specific to THIS session, not generic advice (e.g. "Most support
  time went to Stripe webhook local testing setup — consider a mock").
- If the split is >80% feature work, just say `📊 Pulse: Clean session ✅` — don't
  waste the user's attention on a non-issue.
- If support or rework is >40%, the takeaway must name the specific cause.
- Never frame this as criticism of the user — it's system feedback, not a performance
  review.

**6c. Handoff.MD logging:** when updating Handoff.MD (after major changes and at
context-low), include a one-liner under a `Session efficiency` field:

```markdown
**Session efficiency:** 🎯 ~65% feature · 🔧 ~25% support (Stripe local setup) · 🔁 ~10% rework
```

This builds a lightweight historical signal: after 4–5 sessions the user can see if the
same support-work cause keeps recurring (env setup every time → invest in dev
containers; constant rework → spec clarity problem upstream).

### Close setup

Show one compact summary: the files created, the magic phrase, what happens
automatically from now on, and the single next action ("edit Loop.MD's evals").

---

## INVOCATION ARGUMENTS

- *(no args)* — first-invoke setup, or Ongoing duties in a configured repo.
- **`fmea`** — run an FMEA scan NOW (manual trigger; works regardless of config; if
  config is missing, run the activation prompt first, then scan).
- **`fmea-config`** — re-run the activation prompt and update `.power-coding/config.json`.
- **`sentinel`** — run Sentinel Scan NOW (manual trigger; works regardless of config).
- **`sentinel-config`** — re-run the Sentinel activation prompt, update config.
- **`pulse`** — show Session Pulse NOW for the current session.
- **`pulse-config`** — re-run the Session Pulse activation prompt, update config.
- **`brief`** — run the Layer 0 interview NOW (create or update PRD.md, set
  `context_sources.prd_path`) — for repos that skipped it at setup.

---

## ONGOING DUTIES (any session in a configured repo)

- **Session start:** read Handoff.MD → open with pending points or "what now". Read
  Loop.MD's `status:`.
- **Starting a feature:** scope brake — state the smallest version that proves it works,
  build that first, checkpoint, then extend. If the smallest version reveals an
  architecture-shaping change (new service, external dependency, data-model change,
  async flow), run 3-align's delta proposal and WAIT for approval before code.
- **Working state reached, or risky change ahead:** git checkpoint commit — before the
  risky change, not after it breaks. Obey `consent.git_checkpoints`: `auto` → commit
  and announce in one line; `propose` → ask first.
- **Decision taken (stack / architecture / behavior):** one line in Handoff.MD's
  `Decisions` (date — what — why). Contradicting a logged decision → surface and ask,
  never silently reverse.
- **After major changes:** update Handoff.MD (snapshot, not journal); update the
  relevant `.mmd` if the flow changed.
- **~10% context left:** update Handoff.MD + tell the user the magic phrase. Do this
  *early* — a handoff written at 2% is written badly.
- **Bug reported / flow changed / hard-won fix:** entry in Learning.MD (5-whys format:
  symptom → why-chain → deepest why type → action + preventive action). Before debugging
  anything, *check Learning.MD first* — the answer may already be there.
- **First working draft done & loop not yet offered:** make the offer (2c).
- **Loop on:** free evals ✅/❌ after each change; golden set / paid evals only per
  `consent.paid_evals` (offer at milestones); hypothesis before every paid run.
- **Eval passed 3 consecutive runs:** offer to graduate it into an automated test (2e).
- **FMEA triggers** (per `.power-coding/config.json`): feature declared complete →
  full scan (branch diff vs main) — per `consent.fmea_full_scan`, `ask` (default) means
  offer it first, `auto` means run it; about to commit with `on_pre_commit` → light scan of
  the staged diff, P0 blocks ("fix now or commit anyway?"), P1/P2 inform only;
  `smart_suggest` signal fired (new webhook/API/payment/async/auth/error-handling code,
  200+ line diffs, migrations) → offer a scan at the next natural pause, never twice for
  the same change-set; "run fmea" / "scan for failures" → scan now, any config.
- **After major task completion (if sentinel enabled):** run the four-lens sweep
  (misuse traps, stop signals, silent failures, waste) as one fast pass. No output if
  clean. One-line inline flag per triggered lens. This is peripheral vision — never a
  report.
- **After major milestones (if session_pulse enabled):** show the effort split signal
  (🎯 feature / 🔧 support / 🔁 rework + one specific takeaway) after any Sentinel
  flags. Also include in Handoff.MD updates for cross-session visibility.
- **Stuck twice on the same bug:** stop; write symptom / tried / best hypothesis / which
  diagram box it lives in, into Learning.MD; show the user and ask for direction —
  pointing at a diagram box beats a third blind retry.

## Guardrails

- **Consent model** (every current and future behavior must fit one of these tiers —
  when adding a layer, place its triggers before writing them):
  - *Cheap + append-only* (Sentinel, Pulse, Handoff/Learning/Decisions writes, diagram
    updates) → consent once at setup, then silent auto. NEVER add a per-run question
    for something cheap — question fatigue trains yes-clicking, which destroys the
    checkpoint questions that matter.
  - *Expensive or flow-interrupting* (full FMEA scan → `consent.fmea_full_scan`;
    golden-set / paid eval runs → `consent.paid_evals`) → per-run ask by default,
    configurable to auto via `consent.*` in `.power-coding/config.json`. Turning the
    loop on is NOT consent for paid runs — free and paid tiers are consented
    separately, always.
  - *State-mutating* (git commits, architecture-shaping changes) → explicit upfront
    choice at setup for commits (`auto` announces each; `propose` asks); architecture
    changes ALWAYS ask — no config can silence 3-align.
- Layer questions are asked ONCE at setup — don't re-interview a configured repo.
- Handoff.MD stays one screen; if it doesn't fit, collapse history into Learning.MD.
- The debug tab is a dev aid: label it, keep it out of production, never add it if the
  user chose (A).
- Diagrams tell the truth (AGENT vs FUNCTION labels, real thresholds read from code) —
  a wrong diagram is worse than none, the human debugs against it.
- Decisions that change user-facing behavior, cost money, or alter data are the user's:
  recommend with a reason, then wait.
